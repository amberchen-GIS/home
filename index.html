            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Hey there! I’m Amber, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Geography 
                and double-minoring in GIS&T and English at UCLA. My research interests 
                span several topics, including housing equity and environmental justice. 
                I am also 
                highly interested in population demographics, both in LA County, nationally and worldwide.
                <br><br>
                I have academic experience using ArcGIS, QGIS, and SQL for spatial analysis and cartography. 
                Some of my other skills include designing with Adobe InDesign, applying R in 
                statistical research, and performing data analysis with Microsoft Excel. In 
                the summer before my sophomore year, I interned with Asian Americans Advancing 
                Justice – Atlanta. I gained hands-on experience with data analysis as I navigated
                large demographic datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Georgia 
                Secretary of State.
                <br><br>
                I am currently conducting research with UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs, 
                focusing on housing inequity for Native Americans across the United States. As a GIS researcher, I 
                have plenty of experience manipulating data in ArcGIS Pro, publishing interactive web maps
                with ArcGIS Online, as well as collaborating with professors and other student researchers.
                <br><br>
                Outside of school, I often volunteer with seniors or tutor younger students in English. 
                My passion lies in helping others learn — whether through language or academic 
                research. As a GIS&T scholar, I am eager to share the potential of this emerging 
                field and inspire others to explore it.

            <h2>Analysis of Chinese Population Change Amid Rising Housing Costs in LA County, from 2015 to 2023</h2>
            <a href="Chhou.pdf" target="_blank" class = "h3link">See Full Project</a>

            <h3>
            In December 2025, I conducted an independent academic research project to determine whether Chinese 
                population movement and clustering across LA County were influenced by fluctuating housing values 
                over time. Using ArcGIS Pro, I ran the Hot Spot Analysis (Getis Ord Gi*) tool to identify tracts 
                with significant Chinese populations, then performed calculations to pinpoint zones of Chinese 
                population decline and expansion. Then, I intersected this layer with tracts containing low median 
                housing values compared to the overall county median. 
                <br><br>
            Through spatial analysis, I observed that tracts from 2023 contained high Chinese population concentrations 
                while remaining on the lower end of the housing market compared tracts from 2015. This suggests that 
                between 2015 and 2023, Chinese residents became more concentrated in areas that remained relatively 
                affordable within the broader Los Angeles housing market. Even as housing values drastically increased in 
                surrounding areas, housing costs in the San Gabriel Valley remained relatively stable or increased at rates 
                lower than broader market trends, allowing most Chinese residents to remain in their homes. While potential 
                displacement and expansion appear in Beverly Hills, Pasadena, the San Fernando Valley, and a few other tracts, 
                the San Gabriel Valley remains relatively stable. Moderate displacement is observed in some tracts, but the 
                measured increases in housing value are not substantial enough when adjusted for inflation to firmly attribute 
                Chinese emigration to rising costs. These findings are limited by the availability of housing and population data, 
                as well as null values in tracts that reported Chinese populations of zero in 2015, which could not be computed 
                in the percent change calculations.

            <h2>Zion National Park Static Map</h2>
            <a  href="view.html?image=mp9.jpg" class = "h3link">View Static Map</a>
            <img id = "zion1" src="mp9.jpg" alt="Image" >
            <h3>
            This map is a reproduction of NPS’s official park map, with adjusted symbology and labeling to improve the accessibility of information. My map’s main color scheme consists of shades of red, brown, and orange to match Zion’s natural landscape. To improve readability, I diversified the map’s point symbology, using intuitively understood symbols to further enhance clarity.
            <br><br>
            Previously, the parking lot icon for NPS maps was a small half-circle that was barely visible among all of the other features. To make it more prominent, I changed the icon to a white square with the letter “P,” which is commonly understood to be the parking symbol. This makes parking information easily accessible at a glance.
            <br><br>
            I also decided to make trailheads more prominent, by symbolizing them with brown diamonds. This makes them easy to spot for visitors seeking hiking routes, while preserving visual hierarchy. The diamonds are larger than the small, half-circle dots in the NPS map, but their muted brown color prevents them from overpowering other features. 
            <br><br>
            For Zion’s surrounding areas, I symbolized towns with semi-transparent polygons to show their extents, offering more geographic context than the NPS point symbols. I omitted town elevation labels, which felt unnecessary for this map’s purpose. For significant elevation points, I replaced NPS’ small dots with triangles, a shape more intuitively associated with mountains.
            <br><br>
            On the NPS map, the big, bold title “Zion National Park” dominates the center, with small features squeezed between its wide kerning and line spacing. I took a different approach by moving my title outside the park boundary. Though it still remains the largest label, it sits in a corner where it doesn’t compete with smaller features. This freed up space for additional labels, such as Ivins Mountain, giving visitors more useful information. Adopting this labeling strategy in future NPS maps could help keep the focus on the park itself, instead of the title.
            <br><br>
            Some other labels I adjusted were those of towns, elevation points, and rivers. I set town labels in uppercase to emphasize them as area features and align them with their polygon symbology. For natural features like rivers and mountains, I chose serif fonts to distinguish them from other labels. I gave river labels semi-transparent halos to enhance their readability against the hillshade background. However, I chose to leave geographic features like plateaus and canyons in their original sans-serif, capitalized fonts to preserve clarity and neatness. 
            <br><br>
            Overall, I believe NPS could implement these stylistic adjustments in future maps to make information more immediately readable and accessible to visitors. This way, their maps can allow visitors to understand key details at a glance, and continue on their merry ways to explore the beautiful parks!

                   different classes (or vice versa – place tracts with different
                    values into the same class), which can distort and exaggerate 
                    our perception of actual price differences. In this instance, 
                    the quantile classification decreases the price range of the
